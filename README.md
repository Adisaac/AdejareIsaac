## Adejare Isaac

Hi, I'm Isaac. I'm a frontend developer and web designer.  
I design and build clean, responsive websites that are easy to use and visually compelling.

Currently building Adisaac Ltd, a creative studio focused on helping brands show up better online through intentional design and functional code.


## About Me

I started my journey into tech with a simple desire—to create beautiful and functional digital experiences.  
Coming from a science background, I bring a structured and problem-solving mindset into how I build websites.

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Improving my frontend design and development skills
- Building out my personal portfolio
- Working on small projects to practice and grow
- Learning more about user experience and design thinking

## What I Use
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Netlify, Vercel & GitHub Pages for hosting  

I'm currently learning Tailwind CSS and JavaScript best practices.

## Projects in Progress

Right now, I’m building out my first set of personal projects. These include:
- A personal bio page
- A few landing page layouts
- Responsive form interfaces
- A basic portfolio homepage

Once they’re done, they’ll be live here and hosted as part of my portfolio website.

## What I'm Building

**Adisaac Ltd** is more than just a name. It’s a long-term vision:  
A design-forward brand studio focused on blending code, creativity, and strategy to deliver powerful online experiences.
